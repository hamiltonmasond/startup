HTML/CSS
I've used HTML and CSS quite a bit at my job, but I've rarely used Bootstrap
in the applications I use. With the help of the Simon project and the uses
and research I did on this project, I've been able to get a much better understanding
of how Bootstrap class make stylizing a project much easier. I've also gotten
learned a lot more about forms work and how they can make many tasks more simple code-wise.
