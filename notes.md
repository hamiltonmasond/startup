HTML/CSS
I've used HTML and CSS quite a bit at my job, but I've rarely used Bootstrap
in the applications I use. With the help of the Simon project and the uses
and research I did on this project, I've been able to get a much better understanding
of how Bootstrap class make stylizing a project much easier. I've also gotten
learned a lot more about forms work and how they can make many tasks more simple code-wise.

JavaScript
While I was unable to get any JavaScript to run on my site, I still have a better understanding
of how to integrate JS with HTML projects. While my debugging was unsuccessful, I understand how
to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript and how to create functions that utilize local features to 
make something much more than complex than it seems from the surface.
