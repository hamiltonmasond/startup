My Elevator pitch

I want to create an online store that sells outdoors gear. It will include different types of 
gear and apparel. It will also have forums were you can post tips for trips and adventures, as 
well as an IMing feature to ask other customers and "experts" for opinions on different products 
and brands. You can login to save products on your wishlist and get better deals on products.

Simon - HTML

I learned quite a bit about button structure as well as table structure. Creating the actual SIMON play feature really
pushed what I thought was possible for HTML. I am much more familiar with the different tags for tables and how to
structure them in a way that is aesthetically pleasing.
