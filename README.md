My Elevator pitch

I want to create an online store that sells outdoors gear. It will include different types of 
gear and apparel. It will also have forums were you can post tips for trips and adventures, as 
well as an IMing feature to ask other customers and "experts" for opinions on different products 
and brands. You can login to save products on your wishlist and get better deals on products.

Simon - HTML

I learned quite a bit about button structure as well as table structure. Creating the actual SIMON play feature really
pushed what I thought was possible for HTML. I am much more familiar with the different tags for tables and how to
structure them in a way that is aesthetically pleasing. 

Simon - CSS

I now have a much better understanding of how to integrate regular CSS and Bootstrap at the same time. I have always
had trouble using them both, prefering to use one or the other. Seeing them integrated has help me expand my view
of what is possible with simple CSS.

Simon - JavaScript

Studying the code from the JS files has helped me have a better understanding of how promises are integrated into 
projects. Using async has never been the easiest for me and seeing how it effects the HTML has given me ideas of 
how to best integrate them into my start-up project.

Simon - Service

I successfully deployed the code for the service aspect of the Simon project. I've found that after studying the code
I feel like I have a better understanding of integrating Express into projects. As well as with the assignments, I feel like
I can successfully integrate Node and Express into my start-up and any other projects I have done. Fetch APIs and using middleware
with Express has been very useful.

Simon - Database

I successfully deployed the code for the database aspect of the Simon project. Databases are super useful and I've used lots of SQL
at my current job. I've really appreciated getting to use a new type of database in Mongo and have found it to be more intuitive and
easier to understand than SQL. Studying the code for the project and simply setting up the production environment were both great
learning experiences

Simon - Login

I sucessfully deployed the code for the login aspect of the Simon project. I was surprised at how easy setting up the login is 
with Express and JavaScript. After studying the new code, I found it interesting how it integrate async/await into the process. 
I learned a lot about how you can use fetch and APIs to streamline database retrieval

Simon - WebSocket

I successfully deployed the code for the WebSocket aspect of the Simon project. It was really interesting how easy the switch from 
HTTPS to websocket is, and how it keeps connections really interested me as well. I really appreciate how the websocket is able to 
keep track of multiple connections and I find, based on the new code I studied, that it is a much more efficient means at maintain 
those connections over time.

Simon - React

I successfully deployed the code for the React aspect of the Simon project. I've learned a lot about how to change the DOM with React and
I've found it to be a lot easier than with straight JavaScript. Using the React router helps me better organize and manage my links
and webpages and the Simon project has introduced me to a large array of methods to go about change the DOM and allowing for a better UI
experience.

Startup - HTML and CSS
For the start of the project, I created four pages: the login page(index.html), the home page(home.html), the order/
database page(db.html),and the chat/WebSocket page(ws.html). Each uses main.css as a stylesheet. The login page as 
a text entry space and a button that takes the user
to the home page. The home page introduces the user to the website and gives them the option to order certain outdoor gear items. Clicking an
order button takes them to the order page, where you can find their order and others (as of now it is just a constant table, it is not updated).
The chat page is very simple as of now, just having a simple text box and prompt for the user.

Startup - JavaScript
I created 4 .js files for this section: login.js, index.js, home.js, db.js, and ws.js. If I'd given myself more
time to work on the project I would have been able to expand on each of these, however, I was only able to start
efforts on the login feature. Theoretically it should save the typed username to local storage and display 
it on the home page, but I was unable to achieve this functionality.
